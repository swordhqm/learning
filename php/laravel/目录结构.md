#### models 在哪里
mvc 意义上的models 在app目录里

#### app 目录
application 相关的东西

#### bootstrap 目录
框架是由此目录下的app.php启动的，同时包含cache目录装有框架生成的文件，优化框架速度

#### config 目录
所有可定义化配置

#### database 目录
The database directory contains your database migrations, model factories, and seeds. If you wish, you may also use this directory to hold an SQLite database.

#### public 目录
The public directory contains the index.php file, which is the entry point for all requests entering your application and configures autoloading. This directory also houses your assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS.

#### resources 目录
The resources directory contains your views as well as your raw, un-compiled assets such as LESS, SASS, or JavaScript. This directory also houses all of your language files.

语言文件以及一些less，sass，js文件

#### Routes 目录
路由定义

默认有：
    web.php, 
    api.php, 
    console.php,
    channels.php

RouteServiceProvider 定义在app 中，会有web中间件（加载web.php中路由配置），并 provides session state, CSRF protection, and cookie encryption. 
同时还有api中间件（加载api.php），which provides rate limiting. 
These routes are intended to be stateless, so requests entering the application through these routes are intended to be authenticated via tokens and will not have access to session state.

The console.php file is where you may define all of your Closure based console commands. Each Closure is bound to a command instance allowing a simple approach to interacting with each command's IO methods. Even though this file does not define HTTP routes, it defines console based entry points (routes) into your application.

The channels.php file is where you may register all of the event broadcasting channels that your application supports.

#### Storage 目录
The storage directory contains your compiled Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. This directory is segregated into app, framework, and logs directories. The app directory may be used to store any files generated by your application. The framework directory is used to store framework generated files and caches. Finally, the logs directory contains your application's log files.

The storage/app/public directory may be used to store user-generated files, such as profile avatars, that should be publicly accessible. You should create a symbolic link at public/storage which points to this directory. You may create the link using the php artisan storage:link command.

#### Tests 目录
https://phpunit.de/

The tests directory contains your automated tests. An example PHPUnit is provided out of the box. Each test class should be suffixed with the word Test. You may run your tests using the  phpunit or php vendor/bin/phpunit commands.

#### Vendor 目录
包含composer 依赖

###### App
App 目录由 psr-4 自动加载
宏观上认为，console 和 http目录提供API 到app core。换句话说把 console 和 http 都作为app core的入口。
The Console directory contains all of your Artisan commands, 
while the Http directory contains your controllers, middleware, and requests.

半中用make生成的目录
A variety of other directories will be generated inside the app directory as you use the make Artisan commands to generate classes. So, for example, the app/Jobs directory will not exist until you execute the make:job Artisan command to generate a job class.

#### 利用make 生成目录
查看命令
php artisan list make

#### Console 目录
生成console 命令，绑定命令和对应的task
The Console directory contains all of the custom Artisan commands for your application. These commands may be generated using the make:command command. This directory also houses your console kernel, which is where your custom Artisan commands are registered and your scheduled tasks are defined.

#### Events 目录
生成事件目录，定义事件，用于模块间解耦

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you by the event:generate and  make:event Artisan commands. The Events directory, as you might expect, houses event classes. Events may be used to alert other parts of your application that a given action has occurred, providing a great deal of flexibility and decoupling.

#### Exceptions 目录
用于定义异常，以及如何记录异常
The Exceptions directory contains your application's exception handler and is also a good place to place any exceptions thrown by your application. If you would like to customize how your exceptions are logged or rendered, you should modify the Handler class in this directory.

#### Http 目录
处理http请求逻辑

The Http directory contains your controllers, middleware, and form requests. Almost all of the logic to handle requests entering your application will be placed in this directory.

#### Jobs 目录
application 触发
或者 run synchronously within the current request lifecycle.

https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/queues
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the make:job Artisan command. The Jobs directory houses the 【queueable】 jobs for your application. Jobs may be queued by your application or run synchronously within the current request lifecycle. Jobs that run synchronously during the current request are sometimes referred to as "commands" since they are an implementation of the 【command pattern】.

#### Listeners 目录
定义Event listener 类，接收消息时，处理逻辑

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the  event:generate or make:listener Artisan commands. The Listeners directory contains the classes that handle your events. Event listeners receive an event instance and perform logic in response to the event being fired. For example, a UserRegistered event might be handled by a  SendWelcomeEmail listener.
